            <p>INSTRUCTIONS: Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p>
         <p> 3. One of my friends - John once asked me a question when I was in JS Two. The question was "Do you have a goal”? My reply was that I had one and it was to excel in my promotion examination. That is good but it is a short term one, he replied. "What exactly do you want to become"? he asked further. ‘I am too young for that I can become anything - a doctor, and engineer, a banker, a lawyer, just anything'. I replied and I added, when I get to SS Three, 1 will think about it.

            John then took time to enlighten me: 'Listen Mary, don't deceive yourself, you must have a particular goal. Do you want to become a member of the NFA? Do you know NFA?. No Future Ambition. You have to think of what you want to become right now so that you can study towards it. You don't just wake up one day to become a doctor, a lawyer. What you want to become requires careful planning. For instance, your goal will determine the kind of subjects you want to combine. You will not just combine any subject with any other one. You need to combine the relevant subjects that will lead to your course of study. At the Senior Secondary School level, you will study subjects in different areas like Sciences, Humanities, Business and Technology. They all have different subjects as combinations.
            
            ‘I see, but how did you obtain this vital information?' Mary asked. My father happens to be a Guidance Counsellor and he has explained everything about the choice of a career, to me. Please, don't hesitate to go directly to your Guidance Counsellor in your school, and he or she will counsel you.
            
            So, 'what is your own goal'? I asked. "I want to be a Dentist. I will soon be helping you and other people to take adequate care of their teeth”. I will read Dentistry at the university, John replied. “Thank you, John, you have enlightened me today".
            
           <p> Questions</p>
            
           <p> i.	What was the profession of John's father?</p>
            
           <p> ii.	What work do Guidance Counsellors do according to the passage?</p>

             SUMMARY</h1>
    <p>INSTRUCTION: Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. </p>
            <p> 4. Road accidents in Nigeria are now on the increase. This ugly situation should be checked because many lives are being lost yearly without caution.

                The question is - what are the causes and possible remedies? One of the chief causes is over— speeding by drivers. Many drivers speed without thinking of the possible outcome. This, without doubt, causes road accident.
                
                Secondly, many drivers have faulty brakes. They do not spare time to repair their faulty vehicles but would like to manage them. They do not have time to repair their vehicles. They want to get rich at all costs. This becomes an ill-wind blowing no good to anybody.
                
                Another cause of road accident is the presence of Police checkpoints on roads. This becomes more disadvantageous than what it had originally been intended for. In a bid to dodge the checkpoints, drivers speed so much that they are involved in fatal road accidents.
                
                From the foregoing, it is pertinent to suggest the following solutions to help to minimize road accidents, if not eradicate them. The first solution is that drivers should not over speed. The adage better be late than the late should be drummed into their ears.
                
                Lastly, vehicles should be checked always and maintained all the time to prevent loss of lives as a result of road accidents.
                
                Questions
                
               <p> i. In THREE sentences, one for each, state the causes of road accidents in Nigeria.</p>
                
               <p> ii. In TWO sentences, state two possible remedies remedies of road accidents from the passage</p>
