                    One of the most cherished treasures of my childhood is a memory that has stayed etched in my heart like a nostalgic melody - the annual family camping trips we used to take during the summer holidays. These adventures in the great outdoors were a source of endless joy and excitement, weaving together moments of laughter, exploration, and togetherness that I will forever hold dear.

                    Every year, as the school year drew to a close and the warm embrace of summer enveloped our surroundings, my family would embark on our much-anticipated camping expedition. The preparation for these trips was always a flurry of activity, with everyone pitching in to gather supplies, pack our camping gear, and load up the car with everything we would need for our outdoor escapade.
                    
                    The journey to our camping spot was an adventure in itself, filled with scenic vistas, winding roads, and the anticipation of the adventures that awaited us. As we neared our destination, my excitement would reach a fever pitch, my imagination running wild with visions of exploring the wilderness, roasting marshmallows over a crackling campfire, and sleeping under a blanket of twinkling stars.
                    
                    Once we arrived at our campsite, it was like stepping into a magical wonderland, far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. We would set up our tents amidst towering trees, the crisp scent of pine filling the air, and the soft murmur of a nearby stream providing the perfect soundtrack to our outdoor retreat.
                    
                    Days spent camping were a whirlwind of exploration and adventure. We would hike through lush forests, discovering hidden waterfalls and secret meadows teeming with wildflowers. We would spend lazy afternoons swimming in cool mountain lakes, the sunlight dancing on the water like a million diamonds. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, we would gather around the campfire, sharing stories and laughter as we roasted marshmallows and savored the simple joys of being together as a family.
                    
                    But perhaps the most magical moments of all were the nights spent sleeping under the vast expanse of the starlit sky. Snuggled up in our cozy sleeping bags, we would gaze up at the heavens, marveling at the beauty and wonder of the universe. And as the night grew still and quiet, with only the gentle rustle of the wind through the trees to break the silence, I would feel an overwhelming sense of peace and contentment, knowing that I was surrounded by the boundless love of my family.
                    
                    Looking back on those cherished camping trips fills my heart with warmth and nostalgia. They were more than just vacations; they were opportunities to connect with nature, create lasting memories, and strengthen the bonds that tie our family together. And though the years may have passed and our lives may have taken us in different directions, the memories of those magical summer days will forever remain etched in my heart, a timeless reminder of the joy and wonder of childhood.

    <p>INSTRUCTION: Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p>
            <p>Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

                Since the early 20th century, the Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8°C (1.4°C), for the last 40 years, we have seen the global annual temperature
                rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade and scientists are worried about this development.
                
                Scientists believe that global warming is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of green house gases produced by human activities. It also occurs when carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that
                have bounced off the Earth's surfaces.
                
                Global warming causes a rise in sea levels, a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation, expansion of subtropical deserts, extreme heat waves evident in the loss of four trillion metric tons of ice since 1990s, and lastly death.
                
                Questions
                <p>i.	In TWO sentences, one of each, state the causes of global warming.</p>
                <p>ii.	In THREE sentences, one of each, state the effects of global warming</p> </p>

                1.	Global warming is caused by increasing concent-rations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities.
