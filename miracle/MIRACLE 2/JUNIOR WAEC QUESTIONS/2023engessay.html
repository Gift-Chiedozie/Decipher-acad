         <p> Amaka was late coming home from school, her mother was very worried that something bad must have happened to her as it was not in her nature to come home late. Two hours after the normal closing time, Amaka wasn't home yet, her mother thought of so many bad things that could have happened to her like rape, kidnap or even death, she screamed out loud and attracted neighbours who came to know what the problem was, after she explained to them, they felt pity for her, the women consoled her and assured her that her daughter will be back unharmed while the men went out to the streets in search of Amaka.

            Three hours later, Amaka came back smiling but her joy was short lived when she realized how much pain she had cased her mother.
            
            She explained that she went to play with Chioma, her friend and did not realize that time was far gone. The women cautioned her not to ever do that again, else she will kill her mother with high blood pressure.

    <p>INSTRUCTION: Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p>
            <p>Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

                Since the early 20th century, the Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8°C (1.4°C), for the last 40 years, we have seen the global annual temperature
                rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade and scientists are worried about this development.
                
                Scientists believe that global warming is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of green house gases produced by human activities. It also occurs when carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that
                have bounced off the Earth's surfaces.
                
                Global warming causes a rise in sea levels, a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation, expansion of subtropical deserts, extreme heat waves evident in the loss of four trillion metric tons of ice since 1990s, and lastly death.
                
                Questions
                <p>i.	In TWO sentences, one of each, state the causes of global warming.</p>
                <p>ii.	In THREE sentences, one of each, state the effects of global warming</p> </p>
