         <p>INSTRUCTIONS: Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow </p>
         <p>. The menace of kidnapping in the society has become a very disturbing issue, with different cases of this evil act being reported daily on the news media. Nowadays, some youths have taken up this act as a means of livelihood. They do not mind the pain and sorrow that their action brings to families of their victims. All they want in return for the release of their victims is a ransom. 

The government must be ready to tackle this crime by whatever means possible.
A death sentence should be passed on anyone caught in this evil act.

This will discourage those intending to go into kidnapping. 

The police must be well equipped to respond quickly to reports of kidnapping. 
The vigilante groups in every community should be equipped as well to assist the police.

In a bid to pay the demanded ransom, the relatives of the kidnapped victims end up
borrowing huge amount of money. Some of the victims, whose relatives are not able to raise the money, stay in the hands of the kidnappers for a long period of time with no proper care and sometimes, this leads to their death.

In conclusion, the entire nation must stand up in the fight against kidnapping because it is an enemy to national peace and security.


            Question
            <p>i.	How often do we hear reports of kidnapping?</p>
           <p>ii.How do relatives of the victims manage to pay ransom?</p>

    <p>INSTRUCTION: Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p>
            <p>The world is being ravaged today by so many diseases. One of such diseases is one which is presently causing havoc here in Nigeria. This is the Lassa fever virus. 

                Lassa fever is an illness caused by Lassa virus. Lassa fever virus is mainly a disease that is animal-borne or spread to humans from animals. People most often become infected by inhaling air contaminated with droppings or urine of infested rats, swallowing the virus in food or contaminated utensils and eating rats or non-domesticated animals called bush meat. Lassa fever is believed to be always present in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.
                
                The incubation period for lassa fever is from six days to three weeks. Most people have mild or no symptoms. In those who have symptoms, it begins with flulike illnesses like fever, generalized weakness, sore throat, severe headache, chest pain, nausea,, vomiting,
                abdominal pain and diarrhea.
                
                How do we then prevent these deadly diseases? The most important preventive methods against lassa outbreak is to eliminate rodent habitats by keeping our environments dean, covering up our food properly, and having access to clean water. Also the public must be taught about preparing bush meat by careful use of gloves and thorough
                cooking. This measure also helps to prevent other fever outbreaks such as Ebola virus.
                
                
                Questions
                <p>i.	In two sentences, state how people can contract Lassa fever?</p>
                <p>ii.		In two sentences, state the ways in which we can prevent Lassa fever?</p> 
                <p>iii.In one sentence, state the measure that can also be used in the prevention of 	Ebola virus?
